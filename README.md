# Bats N' Berries
A Minecraft server-side mod for Fabric that makes glow berries and bats useful.

## Features
- When a player (or mob, i.e. Foxes) eats a glow berry, they gain the glowing effect.
- Feeding a glow berry to a bat will make it echolocate, making all mobs and players within (by default) 32 blocks gain the glowing effect.
- Configurable through the gamerules `batSonarMaxDistance`, `batSonarEffectDuration`, and `glowBerryEffectDuration`.
- Bat bucket

## Installation
In singleplayer, install as normal. In multiplayer, you only need to install the mod on the server (client-side will have no effect).
If you want the bat bucket to display the correct texture and name, you also need to add [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) on the server and [enable AutoHost](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/). 
Otherwise, the it will use the bat spawn egg texture.
